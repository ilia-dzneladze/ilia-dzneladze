## Hi there 👋

I am Ilia, a Software Engineer based in Germany.

I believe that **most** problems can be solved with a comprehensive plan and dedicated work.

Alongside my beliefs, I also love building solutions; it gives me satisfaction to solve real problems.

My main tech stack is Python (FastAPI and sometimes Flask), and JavaScript/TypeScript alongside React.

# I am currently looking for an English-speaking 2026 Summer Internship based in Europe, preferably Germany, but up for any opportunity
